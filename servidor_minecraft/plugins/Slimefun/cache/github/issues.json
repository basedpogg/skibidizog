the discord and they have asked that i submit a report here\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\nopen up feather client, install version 1.20, \r\nopen a corresponding paper server that is 1.20,\r\nrun the server once to make sure all the folders appear,\r\nshutdown the server\r\nshove the slimefun file in the plugins folder,\r\nstart the server back up again,\r\nopen the slimefun guide and the steve heads appeared for me\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\ni was expecting the heads not to appear as Steve heads and the like, but for them to appear as they were supposed to, one example being that carbon appears as a black looking type head, but its just Steve\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99d8dc57-ef51-49ee-97f0-b9eb69ce22da)\r\n\n\n### 📜 Server

change like:\r\n```java\r\n                 if (id != null && id.equals(possibleItemId)) { \r\n                     Debug.log(TestCase.CARGO_INPUT_TESTING, \"  Item IDs matched!\"); \r\n  \r\n

Description\r\nFixed not dropping sensitive blocks once and for all\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR takes a different approach from all other solutions. It listens for `BlockPhysicsEvent` which fires before block update. Inside listener it checks if block can be placed in the location where event was fired. This is the best method to listen for collapsing sensitive blocks without a headache with `SENSITIVE_MATERIALS` tag.\r\n\r\nThe only downside of this solution is that it require at least version 1.18 because it uses `BlockData#isSupported` method.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n- #3182\r\n- #3831\r\n- #3009\r\n- #4069\r\n- #4037\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

This behavior also occurs when a block update is triggered. This bug was observed on a server running Minecraft Paper version 1.20.2 and the latest version of Slimefun.\r\nI demonstrated it here with Galactifun, but it happens with all addons that use blocks with physics.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1.

And, the bug has existed for more than 5 months.\r\n\r\nIf a recipe needs [64,32] (total 64+32 = 96 items), the machine(s) can't find the recipe, but I place the items like [32,64], it works.\r\nHowever, it still can find the recipe, but if you place items like [64,64], machine(s) can't find the recipe again.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1.The recipe needs items that amount >64 (but not a multiple of 64)\r\n2.place similar items like [64,64] in machines' input slots\r\n3.Machines doesn't take items\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nThe machines will take 96 items and there's only 32 items in the input slots\n\n### 📷 Screenshots /

`storage.player-data`\r\n  * This accepts two values, `legacy` and `binary`\r\n  * `binary` is marked as experimental\r\n  * `legacy` is the default value for now\r\n* If `binary` (this PR) is selected in the config for player data we will show a large warning banner in the console:\r\n![experimental warning](https://i.walshy.dev/fLzZbBNbIgb2VenGW5.png)\r\n* Created a new BinaryStorage to handle writing the files as binary (more on this later)\r\n* This BinaryStorage is changing the way researches are saved, they're now using their NamespacedKey's rather than incremental IDs. This has been a change we should have made forever ago and this is step 1 to removing these number IDs.\r\n\r\n## Storage choice\r\n\r\nOk so, as you can see from the PR, the storage is done with NBT. The question I'm sure you're asking is why NBT over xyz?\r\nWell, there's a few reasons;\r\n1. Familiarity\r\n  a. Lots of server owners and developers are familiar with NBT. This makes adoption internally and externally _much_ easier (especially with how much MC has leaned into it over the years)\r\n3. Solid storage\r\n  a. NBT is about as small as it can get. Some people think it's inflated, the format isn't. Usage however is. That isn't something any format can really prevent.\r\n4. Existing tooling\r\n  a. Lots of existing tooling exists for server owners to read these files (a bit more on this later as well)\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This is a simple implementation which would have to have the whole file rewritten each time. I'll explore ways to avoid this but without limiting file size, there isn't a great way to do it.\r\n\r\n### Usage example\r\n\r\n(backpack contains 3 Slimefun items; Energized Energy Capacitor, Energized Solar Generator and a Multi Tool VII)\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 walshy  staff  3511 11 Feb 23:41 52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 3.5 KB\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches and a waypoint\r\n\r\nplayer file;\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  3511 12 Feb 00:42 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n3.5 KB\r\n\r\nwaypoint file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  110 12 Feb 00:42 data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n110 bytes\r\n\r\n**Total**: 3.6 KB\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches, a backpack and a waypoint\r\n\r\nplayer file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  8526 12 Feb 00:00 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n8.5 KB\r\n\r\nwaypoint player file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  110 12 Feb 00:00 data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n110 bytes\r\n\r\n**Total**: 8.6 KB\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches (no compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  6875 12 Feb 00:08 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 6.8 KB\r\n\r\n(this is so big because of using namespaces instead of int IDs, these take up way more space per research)\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches (gzip compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  2308 12 Feb 00:06 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 2.3 KB\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches and a waypoint (gzip compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  2457 12 Feb 00:37 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 2.4 KB\r\n\r\n**1,164 bytes** smaller than legacy, **32.1%** reduction in size\r\n(reminder that most of this space will be taken by the namespace researches -- with int IDs this would be much smaller)\r\n\r\n## Tooling\r\n\r\nI'm sure we've all used NBT programs in the past to view an NBT file, [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer) is the biggest one, there's also [NBT Studio](https://github.com/tryashtar/nbt-studio). The goal is for these programs (and others) to be able to view the files. I haven't tested this yet but I think this would be ideal.\r\n\r\nHowever, these only support the compression algorithms that MC support (gzip & zlib). I'd love to use lz4 or zstd. Luckily, MC recently announced lz4 in [snapshot 24w04a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w04a) which will be coming in 1.20.5. This hopefully means one or both of these tools update to support it.\r\nThat still doesn't mean they'd support zstd though so maybe we go lz4?\r\n\r\nSo as we stand today, we can't really go better than gzip/zlib but hopefully soon we can do lz4. Is this ok? How much should we care about existing tooling?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to avoid building our own 😅 \r\n\r\n## For the reviewers\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n\r\n* Are we good with NBT? Any other format people _really_ want?\r\n  * If another format, why? What advantage does it give?\r\n* Do we want to save player data elsewhere?\r\n  * We've been saving to `data-storage/Slimefun/Players` and `data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints` for a long time. If we want to change that, this is the time\r\n  * One change at least I'd like to make is moving waypoints into the player files. I need to figure out exactly how the shared waypoints work though before I do this, they seem to not do anything different but then confused how they're shared.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> As we stand today (12th Feb), looking for a \"yay\" or \"nay\" on the PR approach and answers to the above questions rather than a \"this code and data structure is perfect\".\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- TODO\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Sign off from reviewers we want to go this way\r\n- [ ] Finish up NBT side on dough\r\n  - [ ] Write any more methods that'd be helpful\r\n  - [ ] Document all functions (snooze)\r\n  - [ ] Add more tests covering more complex cases + compression\r\n- [ ] Implement backpack support\r\n- [ ] Cleanup a bit\r\n- [ ] Do some thorough testing\r\n\r\n### After this PR\r\n\r\n* Work on getting to a more stable/finalized API for storage as a whole\r\n* Build migration from legacy -> binary\r\n* Work on moving binary storage to default\r\n\r\n## Census\r\n\r\n**Yay** - 3\r\n@J3fftw1 \r\n@ProfElements \r\n@Sfiguz7 \r\n\r\n**Nay** - 0","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4126/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4114","id":2113622102,"node_id":"I_kwDOATMVe859-1BW","number":4114,"title":"Hazmat suits do not provide radiation protection in 1.17.1","user":{"login":"Boomer-1","id":75179680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTc5Njgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75179680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1","html_url":"https://github.com/Boomer-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Boomer-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2024-02-01T22:28:51Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T02:36:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nAs reported by Gers in the Slimefun Discord here\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/565557184348422174/565569196218384385/1201521452143353918\r\nhazmat suits are not working in 1.17.1.

The first was block storage.\r\nThe second that came up was that because worlds have thousands more machines than they used to years ago, that there's too many slimefun items to get all the data saved before the server shuts down.\r\n\r\nIt's been discussed that it seems to happen a lot more often with items placed within the 10 minutes before a server restart. Unfortunately no one has been able to consistently confirm this. \r\n\r\nNetworks and IE have been the subject of this discussion quite frequently, but its because they are 2 of the most commonly used addons, however it's been brought up in the discord with core and multiple addons having this happen.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nno items should leave sf data behind after breaking  to cause this. when sf machines are mined, it should be as if nothing was ever there.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\nno error reports get generated.\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nbeen happening for some time. \n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107","id":2092003244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85kn4uW","number":4107,"title":"Make the CropGrowthAccelerator take speed into account (grow multiple…","user":{"login":"pustinek","id":21089157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDg5MTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21089157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek","html_url":"https://github.com/pustinek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"✨ Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-01-20T10:34:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-25T18:23:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4107","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"… blocks at once)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nThis fixes the crop growth accelerator and makes it work as is advertised. \r\nBefore it's only accelerating the growth of one block at at time instead of based on the Speed parameter of the accelerator.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nJust take into account the speed of the accelerator block\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Have two signed books (A and B).\r\n2. Place these blocks (listed from left to right, but placement order does not matter, appaerently):\r\n   - Chest,\r\n   - Cargo Node (Input),\r\n   - Cargo Manager\r\n   - Cargo Node (Output),\r\n   - Chest.\r\n 3. Set the Cargo Node (Input) type to Blacklist.\r\n 4. Insert the book to be copied (A) into the right (output) chest.\r\n 5. Insert the other book (B) into the left (input) chest.\r\n 6. In the right chest you will have the copied book (A) two times.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to player heads.\r\n\r\nAlso it works for higher quantities of items: for example, if you were to fill the right chest with the A books, and then proceed to insert some B books into the left chest, the item stacks in the right chest will all get eventually filled up.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you would only have 1 A book in the right chest and you were to put 17 B books into the left chest, you would end up with 16 A books and 2 B books in the right chest. So the issue is clearly **linked to incomplete item stacks**.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the B book to transfer to the right (output) chest, instead of getting another A book.\r\n\r\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\nSee the bug reproduction process screencap: https://ctrlv.tv/ZLMh\r\n\r\n### 📜 Server Log\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### 💻 Server Software\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\r\n\r\n1.17.x\r\n\r\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n```\r\nThis Server uses the following setup of Slimefun:\r\nPaper git-Paper-411 (MC: 1.17.1)\r\nSlimefun RC -

This applies to all the types [listed on the wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recipe#crafting_special_*). This renders automating the crafting of items like firework rockets or dyed shulker boxes impossible.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a server running just Slimefun on Paper.\r\n2. Obtain an Vanilla Auto Crafter.\r\n3. Crouch + Right Click with one of the items listed under the special crafting category.\r\n4. The Vanilla Auto Crafter will say no recipe for the item can be found.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nThe Vanilla Auto Crafter will attempt to find a recipe within reason for a given item. This would be a recipe of gunpowder and paper for a flight duration 1 explosion-less firework rocket.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n[Larger than 10mb, put on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pRBggUAJY)\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/PpvkMTfh\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\n![image](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/98472539/0d9803f5-ef45-4b36-8c54-45e2887f3446)\r\n\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","id":1981405244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85ezymk","number":4018,"title":"Add Horizontal Offset support to Holograms","user":{"login":"test137E29B","id":37277599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc3NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37277599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B","html_url":"https://github.com/test137E29B","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683831333,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODMxMzMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%88%20Feature","name":"🎈 Feature","color":"C8E3F2","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request adds a new feature."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-11-07T13:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T15:41:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4018","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nHologram projectors are really nice things to use, but they lack horizontal offset support meaning any design without a central block annoyingly has an offset hologram.

Once when you put on the armor and quickly wear on a different leather armor (even custom one), it's recolored then too. This mess up with other armors and especially custom armors, cuz these needs specific colors to work.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Put on rainbow chestplate or any other part\r\n2. Take it off\r\n3. Quickly put on basic leather armor, it's recolored.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nDo not recolor other armors.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/75527300/2747fa92-b06d-4bb2-90ea-638b79cc5491\r\n\r\n\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.19.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nSlimefun version DEV - 1087 (git dc22e665)\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929","id":1827890358,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85WuyNC","number":3929,"title":"exploded sf blocks now drop their sf item","user":{"login":"iTwins","id":48769316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzY5MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48769316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins","html_url":"https://github.com/iTwins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."},{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"✨ Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."},{"id":4270511434,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATMVe87-itVK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9A%A0BLOCKED","name":"⚠BLOCKED","color":"FF0000","default":false,"description":"This pull request is currently blocked from merging for technical reasons."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2023-07-30T10:49:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-31T09:44:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/3929","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nSlimefun blocks didn't drop when exploded because the ``drops`` argument in ``BlockBreakHandler::onExplode`` did nothing.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n~~Pass the ``SlimefunItem`` to the ``handleEplosion`` method in ``ExplosionsListener.java`` and drop the item there.~~\r\n\r\n~~Other changes:~~\r\n~~Removed unused import.~~\r\n\r\n~~I didn't change the method signature for ``BlockBreakHandler::onExplode`` since it's a public method and that seemed like a bad idea to change.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed approach completely.

❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nWhen a member logged on and messed with the Slimefun components, one output chest was working while the other was not and when he tried to use an energy regulator it did not show him as owner rather it shown CS-CoreLib as owner and when he tried to destroy it and place it back it just shown it as CS-CoreLib's head rather than an actual component including the \"Connecting...\" hologram as well as the Simple Elevator when trying to be used it doesn't work and when destroyed and put into inventory it says Block of Quartz. After these problems rose, I saw in the console a message that states \"[20:15:08 ERROR]: [Slimefun] An Exception was caught while ticking the Block Tickers Task for Slimefun vDEV - 1068 (git cab97b1a)\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: World \"Teknocraft S3.5\" seems to have been deleted. Do not call unsafe methods directly!\" Even though in the world settings folder of Slimefun has the world on it. The software used is a mixture of different softwares combined: Spigot, Paper, Purpur and Bukkit.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Updated  to the latest version\r\n2. Uploaded it to my server's file manager\r\n3. Restarted the server\r\n4.

Description\n\nEnabling `call-explosive-event` on explosive tools caused only the targeted Slimefun blocks to be dropped and drop nothing on the exploded part. This only happens to Slimefun blocks, vanilla blocks will drop just fine. Also this seems to clear block storage data on that coordinate as well.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Enable `call-explosive-event` on explosive pickaxe\r\n2. Try to break Slimefun blocks\r\n3.

Description\n\nSome days ago someone reported that they can't craft an [ElectricSpawner](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners).\r\n\r\nBoomer and I checked on this and found out that having extra NBT Tags in this case we will focused on `CustomModelData`, made the item not accepted by the recipe.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a Core Slimefun issue that is why I'm posting it here rather
